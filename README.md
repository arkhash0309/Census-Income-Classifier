<h1>Predicting Income based on Census Data</h1>
<p>A simple classification problem is solved using Machine Learning, where a prediction is made as to whether the income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.</p>
<p>The following models were used for this project:</p>
<li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
<li>Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier</li>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<li>XGBoost Classifier</li>
<br/>
<p>It was significant that the Random Forest Classifier performed better for this model than the Naive Bayes on many measurement metrics.</p>
<p>However, other algorithms such as XGBoost and Adaptive Gradient Boosting could be tried to analyse and come up with a more efficient model.</p>
