<h1>Predicting Income based on Census Data</h1>
<p>A simple classification problem is solved using Machine Learning, where a prediction is made as to whether the income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.</p>
<p>The following models were used for this project:</p>
<li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
<li>Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier</li>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<li>XGBoost Classifier</li>
<br/>
<p>The XGBoost Classifier proved to be the most efficient model, closely followed by the Logistic Regression model and the Random Forest Classifier.</p>
<p>The Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier was not upto the level of the other three models as it provided an accuracy score of only about 60%</p>
